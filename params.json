{"name":"Mesh Bee Firmware Project","tagline":"Powerful tiny thing","body":"### The Canvas\r\n\r\nHere we created a magical ZigBee module - **Mesh Bee**.\r\n\r\n![image](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/images/thumb/e/ef/Mesh_bee.jpg/600px-Mesh_bee.jpg)\r\n\r\n  MeshBee is a low-cost, community-supported zigbee wireless development platform for developers and hobbyists.It uses microchip JN516x from NXP that enables several different standards-based zigbee mesh networking which makes it more easy and cost-effective to integrate ZigBee functionality into target project.   \r\n  MeshBee is the best choice to make your connected thing. \r\n\r\n\r\n### System Diagram\r\nYou can develop a stand-alone application in AUPS(Arduino user programming space). The user application consists of two arduino-style functions at the top level: setup & loop, which act just like arduino's. The latest firmware wraps the complicated ZigBee stack operation into a few easy-to-use serial commands, and drives Mesh Bee into a transparent serial communication node that can be part of a simple point-to-point connection or a complex mesh network. \r\nMeshBee has four basic mode: AT/MCU/DATA/API, you can choose one which meets your request best.\r\n\r\n ![image](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/images/f/f2/MeshBeeArchitecture0603.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Main Roadmap:\r\nThis is a simple roadmap intended to give a basic understanding of the project's history for anyone who wants to follow us or contribute.   \r\n~~1. Handle ZigBee network formation~~  \r\n~~2. Configuration persistent when reboot~~    \r\n~~3. OTA support~~    \r\n~~4. AT commands to configure Mesh Bee~~  \r\n    ~~* Show node's information~~    \r\n    ~~* Whether re-form the network when power up~~    \r\n    ~~* Whether re-scan the network when power up~~    \r\n    ~~* Whether auto join network searched~~    \r\n    ~~* List all networks scanned~~    \r\n    ~~* Select a network to join~~     \r\n    ~~* Change the baud rate of UART1~~    \r\n    ~~* Broadcast or unicast~~    \r\n    ~~* Unicast destination address~~    \r\n    ~~* OTA~~    \r\n    ~~* Sleep end device~~  \r\n~~5. DATA mode~~  \r\n~~6. API mode~~  \r\n~~7. MCU mode with AUPS(Arduino-ful user programming space).~~  \r\n~~8. End device supports cyclic Sleep mode~~  \r\n~~9. End device supports pin wake.~~  \r\n~~10. implement micro-RPC~~       \r\n11. More powerful API frame like XBee    \r\n12. Deep sleep mode    \r\n13. Cross platform configuration Tools(Configure MeshBee in a friendly way, generate API frame, monitor the network)     \r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n If you have any ideas or questions, need help, or are looking for collaborators, you'll find everything you need in our forums and in our community.
